# Netlify Deployment Instructions

## Quick Fix for Your Portfolio

### Option 1: Manual Build & Deploy
1. Run this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. This creates a `build` folder with your React app
3. Go to Netlify dashboard
4. Drag and drop the `build` folder to deploy

### Option 2: Connect GitHub Repository
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose "GitHub"
4. Select your repository: `Suhail-Zenic-Portfolio`
5. Netlify will automatically detect the settings from `netlify.toml`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 3: Update Existing Site
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"
5. This will use the new `netlify.toml` configuration
